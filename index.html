    <h2>THE Lebron James</h2>

    <img src="img/download.jpg" alt="">
    <p>LeBron James isn’t just better than MJ—he’s the evolution of greatness. He’s bigger, faster, and more versatile. LeBron can guard all five positions, run the offense like a point guard, and dominate the paint like a center. He’s the all-time leading scorer and top five in assists, which is wild when you realize MJ wasn’t even close in those categories. LeBron’s been to the Finals ten times, with different teams, in different eras, and is still performing at an elite level in his 20s-plus season. Meanwhile, MJ took breaks and had a shorter prime. And let’s not even talk about the off-court impact—LeBron built a school, empowered communities, and stayed out of controversy in a social media era where every move is under a microscope.  👑

    <h2>Crocodilo Bombardino</h2>
    <img src="img/Bombardiro_Crocodilo.webp" alt="Has layer">
    <p>Crocodilo Bombardino is the absolute embodiment of internet absurdity at its finest—and that’s what makes him so iconic. He’s a crocodile, he’s a bomber plane, and he speaks in a hilariously broken Italian accent courtesy of a text-to-speech voice that sounds like it’s been possessed by pure chaos. None of it should work, but somehow it totally does. He’s the crown jewel of the “Italian Brainrot” meme wave, flying through explosions, spitting nonsense poetry, and leaving a trail of confused laughter behind him. Bombardino isn’t just a meme character—he’s a surreal fever dream with style, swagger, and the kind of unhinged charm that the internet lives for.</p>
